## Technical Implementation Details

### Edit Flow
1. User clicks edit button on a card
2. Navigation passes card ID as parameter to EditCardScreen
3. EditCardViewModel loads card data by ID
4. User modifies name, prefix, or suffix
5. Form validation ensures name is not empty
6. UpdateCardUseCase saves changes to repository
7. User is navigated back to main screen

### Delete Flow
1. User clicks delete button on a card
2. MainViewModel shows confirmation dialog with card name
3. User confirms deletion
4. DeleteCardUseCase removes card from repository
5. Dialog is dismissed and card is removed from list

### Error Handling
- Network errors during card operations
- Validation errors for required fields
- Database errors during save/delete operations
- Loading states during async operations

## Files Modified/Created

## UI/UX Improvements

- Loading states provide user feedback
- Error messages help users understand issues
- Consistent Material Design 3 styling
- Proper accessibility support

## Build Considerations
The implementation is complete and ready for testing. However, there are currently network connectivity issues preventing build verification. The code follows Android best practices and should compile successfully once build environment connectivity is restored.
